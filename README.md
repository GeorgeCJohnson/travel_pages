## Description 

TravelPages is constructed upon the robust foundation of Node.js, harnessing the expressive capabilities of the Express framework for flawless server-side development. We optimize data management by utilizing the MySQL database driver for Node.js, ensuring efficient data storage and retrieval.

We take session management seriously by integrating express-session and connect-session-sequelize, guaranteeing reliable and persistent session storage. Your user authentication data is handled with utmost security, employing bcrypt password hashing and encryption to safeguard your online presence.

To elevate your browsing experience, we employ the dynamic HTML template engine express-handlebars, allowing for the creation of captivating and interactive web pages. Furthermore, we leverage Bootstrap, a renowned front-end framework known for its extensive collection of pre-built CSS and JavaScript components. This ensures a visually stunning and responsive web design, enhancing user engagement and satisfaction on TravelPages.
